# Fake Image Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

## 📌 Overview
This notebook presents a **computer vision and machine learning application** focused on the **detection of fake (manipulated or AI-generated) images**.

The main objective is to analyze image data and determine whether a given visual input is **real or artificially generated**, using data mining and machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fake or manipulated images using AI-based approaches
- Extract meaningful visual features from images
- Train and evaluate classification models
- Analyze model performance using standard evaluation metrics

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The notebook follows a structured workflow:

1. Image data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature extraction from visual inputs  
3. Model training using supervised learning  
4. Evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics  
5. Analysis of results and limitations
